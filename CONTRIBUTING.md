<h1>Contributing to Team Awesome UML</h1>
<p>Welcome, and thank you for contributing to this project!</p>
<p>This document will outline the ways in which you may contribute beyond writing code.</p>
<h2>Asking Questions and Providing Feedback</h2>
</p>All questions and feedback can be directly sent to the team at TeamAwesomeMIT@gmail.com.  If your feedback involves an issue
with the project feel free to report an issue.  Steps on how to do so are described below.</p>
<h2>Reporting Issues</h2>
<p>Has a reproducible issue been found in UML? Do you want to request a new feature?  Ways to effectively do so are outlined below.</p>
<h3>Look For Existing Issues</h3>
<p>If you come across an issue do the following before making a new issue:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be sure to search through the open issues tab for existing reports on the issue or new feature.</li>
  <li>If you find an existing report leave a relevant comment and add a reaction.  Use reactions to upvote or downvote an issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you cannot find an existing report for your issue or new feature, create one using the below guidelines.</p>
<h3>Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests</h3>
<p>File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not file multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.</p>
<p>Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.</p>
<p>The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.</p>
<p>Templates for bug reports and feature requests can be found under the code tab in the .github directory under the ISSUE_TEMPLATE subdirectory.<p>
<h2>Contributing code</h2>
<p>If you are intrested in contributing code for new features or bug fixes, please see the pull request template in the .github directory.</p>
